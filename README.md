# Thunderbuild

## What is this?
I started out this project using python, which was going well until I had to use it's type system.
Python is not well suited for strong/static typing and accessing type information at runtime is not intuitive.
Plus I would have to jump through even more hoops to get a standalone executable.

So I switched to zig, which, while having it's own issues and hiccups, has been nice.

This implementation is broken and incomplete, but you can try messing with it if you like.
